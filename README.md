# Kotlin Practice

A collection of small Kotlin exercises, simulations, and logic problems. Each problem lives in its own folder with a short write-up and a runnable Kotlin file. This is a space for me to explore the language, experiment with ideas, and build a library of examples I can reference later.

## Problems

- [Monty Hall](problems/monty-hall/README.md)

More problems will be added over time.

## How to Run

You can open the repo in IntelliJ and run any file with a `main()` function, or compile from the command line with:

```bash
kotlinc <filename>.kt -include-runtime -d app.jar
java -jar app.jar
